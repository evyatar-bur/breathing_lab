# breathing - lab report

The files in this repository are a part of a breathing lab report, made by
guy masad and evyatar burshtein.

In order to use each one of the codes, all that is needed is to run the
code.

Only when running Part_3 (our application), the user should change the file
name to the name of the signal that you wish to process.


Thank you, and have a good day. I said good day.
